\description{
Federal electoral division boundaries 2010 to 2019
}
\details{
a single tibble with the federal division boundaries for 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019 federal elections.
These are called \code{ced_boundaries} to follow the ABS practice of referring to these as Commonwealth
Electoral Divisions (AEC does not use the term "Commonwealth election" but "federal election" instead).

These maps have been simplified to 10% of their original size on the ABS website, and cropped to the bounding box
that was in use in 2010 (which excludes some far western islands that were in the 2016 and later maps),
